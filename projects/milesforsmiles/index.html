  <p>Operation: Miles for Smiles was a fundraising drive in which a group of bicyclists toured from California to Florida to raise funds for charity. They needed a website to promote their project and to allow donors and the public to track their progress across the country in real time.</p>
<p>The web team consisted of <a href="http://www.sallmadsen.com/">Scott Madsen</a> and me. He designed the website&rsquo;s look-and-feel, while I turned his design into HTML and wrote the back end.</p>
<p>Ruby on Rails was chosen as the framework primarily because it enabled rapid development of a dynamic web application. We intended to do somewhat complex mashups utilizing various web services, and wanted to be able to stand that up as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The end result featured:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple administrative panel enabling basic WYSIWYG manipulation of each page on the site</li>
<li>Multiple editor user accounts</li>
<li>A Google Maps and Twitter mashup along with our geolocation waypoint data that allowed users to track the riders&rsquo; progress across the country on a map, along with geolocated tweets</li>
<li>A photo gallery pulling images from Flickr, which enabled quick uploading of photos while on the road</li>
</ul>
<p>The fundraising project successfully concluded in June 2011, and the web site is currently offline.</p>
